## Description
Code Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior.

Advantages of Refactoring:
1. Improved code readability and reduced complexity.
2. Improve the source code's maintainability. 
3. Improved performance.

### Motivation
* Refactoring to make the existing code meet web accessibility standards and optimize it for the search engines.

### Problems Solved
* Consolidating CSS Selectors and properties to follow semantic structure of the HTML elements.
* Made HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* Added accessible alt attributes to images.
* Made a sequential order for heading attributes.
* Updated existing title to a concise and descriptive one.
* Ensured all links functioning correctly.

### Tools & Technologies used
